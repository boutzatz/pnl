            *************************
            ** Installation of PNL **
            *************************

Depending on whether you are using an official release or the development
version available using subversion from http://gforge.inria.fr/pnl, the
installation differs. We describe here the different procedures.

0. Dependencies

    There are no required dependencies to compile PNL. However, users
    should know that :
    - Linear Algebra routines mainly rely on Blas & Lapack. If these
    two libraries are not found on the machine, the versions shipped with
    PNL are used. For better performances, one should consider using
    Atlas.
    - When an MPI implementation is detected on the computer, some MPI
    bindings are available which enable to natively handle PnlObjects.

1. Official Releases

    A. Under Unix

        Extract the tarball and change to the newly create directory named
        pnl-XXX where XXX is the version number. Then, run the following
        command
        > ./configure
        > make
        > make install

        Per default, the make install command installs the library where it
        has been extracted. You can specify an other directory where to
        install the library by specifying the option --prefix=/new/path/ to
        the configure script. The default behaviour corresponds to
        --prefix=`pwd`

        The configure script accepts several options, just run
        > ./configure --help
        to get a complete lists of options.


    B. Under Windows

        1. Extract the zip file, this will create a directory named pnl-XXX
           where XXX is the version number.
        2. Launch Visual C++ command prompt and change to directory
            pnl-XXX/lib. In this directory, run
                lib.exe /def:libpnl.def /out:libpnl.lib
            This command creates the .lib file needed by Visual to link a
            project to an external library.
        3. Copy the files libpnl.dll libblas.dll liblapack.dll from
            pnl-XXX/lib to the Release and Debug directories of your Visual
            project.
        4. Add the directory /path/to/pnl-XXX/include to the list of
            directories where to search for header files.
        5. Add the directory /path/to/pnl-XXX/lib to the list of
            directories where to search for libraries when linking
        6. Add libpnl.lib as an additional dependency of your project


2. Development version

    Actually no Visual Studio project is provided, so to compile PNL under
    Windows you need to create the project yourself.

    We assume you have a complete checkout of the subversion trunk
    repository. To compile this version, you need the following tools:

        libtool
        autoconf
        automake

    Run the following commands

    > ./autogen.sh
    > make
    > make install

    Per default, the make install command installs the library where it has
    been extracted. You can specify an other directory where to install the
    library by specifying the option --prefix=/new/path/. The default
    behaviour corresponds to --prefix=`pwd`

3. Building the documentation

    If you downloaded an official release, the documentation is already
    built in. This section is only devoted to users working with the
    development version.

    Two different types of documentation are available :

    - The user manual available both in PDF and HTML format, change to
    directory man and issue
        > make (to compile the PDF version, you need a latex compiler)
        > make html (to compile the html version, you need tex4ht)

    - The internal documentation generated using Doxygen, go to directory
    doc and run
        > make (you need to have Doxygen installed)
    
4. For any versions

    Once you have run the make install command, you will find the headers
    of the library into prefix/include/pnl and the dynamic and static
    versions of the library in prefix/lib.

    An executable to test the features of the library can found in
    prefix/bin
