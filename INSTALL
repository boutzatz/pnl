            *************************
            ** Installation of PNL **
            *************************

Depending on whether you are using an official release or the development
version available using subversion from http://gforge.inria.fr/pnl, the
installation differs. We describe here the different procedures.

0. Dependencies

    There are no required dependencies to compile PNL. However, the user
    should know that :
    - The Linear Algebra routines mainly rely on Blas & Lapack. If these
    two libraries are not found on the machine, the versions shipped with
    PNL are used. For better performances, one should consider to use
    Atlas.
    - When an MPI implementation is detected on the computer, some MPI
    bindings are available which enable to natively handle PnlObjects.

1. Official Releases

    Just extract the tarball and change to the newly create directory named
    pnl-XXX where XXX is the version number. Then, run the following
    command
    > ./configure
    > make
    > make install

    Per default, the make install command installs the library where it has
    been extracted. You can specify an other directory where to install the
    library by specifying the option --prefix=/new/path/. The default
    behaviour corresponds to --prefix=`pwd`

    The configure script accepts several options, just run
    > ./configure --help
    to get a complete lists of options.

2. Development version

    We assume you have a complete checkout of the subversion trunk
    repository. To compile this version, you need the following tools:

        libtool
        autoconf
        automake

    Run the following commands

    > ./autogen.sh
    > make
    > make install

    Per default, the make install command installs the library where it has
    been extracted. You can specify an other directory where to install the
    library by specifying the option --prefix=/new/path/. The default
    behaviour corresponds to --prefix=`pwd`

3. Building the documentation

    Two different types of documentation are available :

    - The user manual available both in PDF and HTML format, change to
    directory man and issue
        > make (to compile the PDF version, you need a latex compiler)
        > make html (to compile ht html version, you need tex4ht)

    - The internal documentation generated using Doxygen, go to directory
    doc and run
        > make (you need to have Doxygen installed)
    
4. For any versions

    Once you have run the make install command, you will find the headers
    of the library into prefix/include/pnl and the dynamic and static
    versions of the library in prefix/lib.

    An executable to test the features of the library can found in
    prefix/bin
