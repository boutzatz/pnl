PREMIA is a software for pricing and hedging options on assets and
interest rates and for calibration of financial models.

It is developped by the MathFi research group, which gathers
scientists from INRIA (the french national institute for research in
computer science and control), ENPC (CERMICS laboratory on applied
mathematics and computing), and the University of Marne la Vallée.


1- The directories

   The directory Src/ contains the source code.

   The directory man/ contains the documentation of the algorithms
   implemented in Premia.  Please refer to the README file in this
   directory.



2- Compilation

   *** Compilation under Linux

   To compile Premia under Linux, issue the following commands
   in the top level directory
      ./autogen.sh
      make
      make install
        

   These commands create an executable PremiaTerm under the
   bin/ directory and a shared library libpremia.so available in
   the lib directory.

   A few options are available for the configure command, you can get
   a summary of them by running 
      ./configure --help



   *** Compilation under Windows with Cygwin

   Proceed in the same way as under Linux.

   You will need to have installed the folowing Cygwin packages :
      Devel (default packages)
      autoconf*
      automake*
      binutils
      gcc and gcc-g++
      libtool
      make

   The executable generated is PremiaTerm.exe
