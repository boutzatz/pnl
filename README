               ******************************


1/ Compilation

    1.1 If you have downloaded a tarball of the library, simply run
      ./configure
      make
      make install
    
      The documentation of the library is available in the directory man
      as a pdf pnl-manual.pdf and in the directory man/pnl-man.html as a
      bunch of html files.
   
    1.2 If you have checked out a development version using svn, simply run
      sh autogen.sh
      make
      make install

      You need to compile the documentation yourself.
      Go to directory man and 
        - for the pdf version, run make (you need a LaTeX compiler). 
        - for the html version, run make html (you need tex4ht). 

2/ Using the library

   If we want to use the library to develop your own code, here is one way of doing it.

   1/ create a new directory at the top level.

   3/ Copy the Makefile located in perso/ to your new directory and
   edit it according to your needs. 
   To define your target just add the executable name, say my-exec, to the BINS
   list and create an entry
   my_exec_OBJS 
   carrying the list .o files file needed to create your executable by.
   Note that the '-' in executable names are placed by '_' to create the
   corresponding _OBJS variable
   

   4/ Before running make, be sure that you have already run in the
      top level directory
           ./configure
           make 
           make install
