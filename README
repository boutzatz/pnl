               ** Premia Numerical Library **
               ******************************


1/ Compilation

   To compile the library launch
      sh autogen.sh
      make
      make install
   
   The documentation of the library can be built by running make in
   the directory doc. You must have doxygen installed.

2/ Using the library

   If we want to use the library to develop your own code, here is one way of doing it.

   1/ create a new directory at the top level.

   3/ Copy the Makefile located in perso/ to your new directory and
   edit it according to your needs. You must specify the list of .o
   file needed to create your executable by properly filling the
   variable OBJS. The variable TARGET must be assigned to the name of
   your executable.

   4/ Before running make, be sure that you have already run in the
      top level directory
           sh autogen.sh 
           make 
           make install
