- random.c : SOBOL and SOBOL2 are not handled by pnl_rng_sdim

- Recode Sobol

- Integrate the latest version of DCMT

- List structure
       * Add a pnl_list_copy function. It implies to add a
         copy function to PnlObject

- Some code can be factorized in libminpack

- splines 
    CMlib 
    in scilab routines/callelm/somespline.f

- Complex tridiag and band matrices
    I am not sure these storages are so meaningful for complex data

- Should dgemm use Blas ?
    Probably yes, if we can differentiate between Blas & Atlas, because
    using Fortran style storage induces several temporary copies so it must
    be worth it.

- interface dgesvd
