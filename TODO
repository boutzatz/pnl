- Seed for MRGK3 and MRGK5

- List structure
       * Add a pnl_list_copy function. It implies to add a
         copy function to PnlObject

- Some code can be factorized in libminpack

- splines 
    CMlib 
    in scilab routines/callelm/somespline.f

- Complex tridiag and band matrices
    I am not sure these storages are so meaningful for complex data

- Should dgemm use Blas ?
    Probably yes, if we can differentiate between Blas & Atlas, because
    using Fortran style storage induces several temporary copies so it must
    be worth it.

- interface dgesvd

- Tests should be refactored.

- Recode Sobol

- Integrate the latest version of DCMT

- Linear algebra decomposition methods should return FAIL or OK
