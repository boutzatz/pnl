- Create a List structure and use it in MPI

- Some code can be factorized in libminpack

- Create an object for Random Number Generators
    We also want to tackle the problem of generating random numbers
    in a parallel environment. This constraint must be taken into 
    account when devising the RNG object.

- splines 
    CMlib 
    in scilab routines/callelm/somespline.f

- Complex tridiag and band matrices
    I am not sure these storages are so meaningful for complex data

- Should dgemm use Blas ?
    Probably yes, if we can differentiate between Blas & Atlas, because
    using Fortran style storage induces several temporary copies so it must
    be worth it.

- interface dgesvd
