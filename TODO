- Create an object for Random Number Generators
    We also want to tackle the problem of generating random numbers
    in a parallel environment. This constraint must be taken into 
    account when devising the RNG object.

- Bindings for MPI
    At least for vectors, matrices, (hypermatrices ?) and RNG.

- splines 
    CMlib 
    in scilab routines/callelm/somespline.f

- interface dgesvd

- binding for quadpack (numerical integration + ode)

- integrate the BFGS algorithm written by Ismail

- mutlivariate zero searching

- Complex tridiag and band matrices
    I am not sure these sotrages are so meaningful for complex data

- Should dgemm use Blas ? 
    Probably yes if we can differentiate between Blas & Atlas, because using
    Fortran style storage induces several temporary copies so it must be worth
    it.
